                    Hey there, folks! I'm Angolan, tech enthusiast, and I've been riding the <br/>
                    wild waves of the IT world for the past 7 years. I dove into a startup <br/>
                    (because who doesn't love a good challenge, right?), and now I'm all <br/>
                    about being a software consultant – you know, the kind that fixes bugs <br/>
                    before you even say 'bug'!<br/>
                    When I'm not untangling lines of code, you'll find me out there <br/>
                    exploring the world. I'm a challenge lover, and that applies <br/>
                    whether I'm debugging or exploring a new spot. If you spot <br/>
                    someone taking photos of everything, that's probably me – I love <br/>
                    capturing moments, especially when I'm soaking up a new travel <br/>
                    adventure.<br/>
                    And between you and me, nothing beats hanging out with family and <br/>
                    friends, whether it's hashing out ideas about the latest crazy project or <br/>
                    just laughing until our sides hurt.<br/>
                    Wanna chat about tech, challenges, or even that dream trip you're <br/>
                    planning? Pull up a chair, because around here, we only get serious <br/>
                    when the code compiles!
